# Data Visualization: Exploring and Explaining Data

Data visualization techniques are for exploring data for trends and patterns or to explain insight to stakeholders. When plots are for exploration, speed is a priority over readability. After the data exploration phase, the analyst selects and polishes the most important visualizations to tell a data story to stakeholders. These polished upgraded visualizations are called explanatory data visualizations.

The purpose of data analysis is to tell a data story to stakeholders. Statistics, plots, and context together make a data story. Data visualization focuses on plotting. These plots can be on a certain number of features in a dataset. Typically when exploring data, a single column is chosen for exploration at a time using univariate plots. After that, to see how two or more variables interact, an analyst creates bivariate and multivariate plots.

The code contained in these Jupyter Notebooks shows how to generate exploratory plots ranging from basic to advanced and how to transform them into finished explanatory visualizations. All the code and datasets are available so that the charts are reproducible. It would be even better to remake the plots on a different dataset and modify them.
